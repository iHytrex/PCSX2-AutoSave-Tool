**PCSX2 AUTO-SAVE**


**What is this?** A Windows only tool for PCSX2 that generate sstates at user-specified intervals.

**How to use:** Specify an autosave interval in the numericUpDown, then press START. A new thread will be created, pressing F1 every X minutes. To stop the key pressing, make sure to press the "STOP button."

**Use Multiple Save Slots:** If checked, the program is always going to switch save slots before saving. (This way you can return to a previous save state, just like some sort of backup.)

**Beta:**

- The "backup states" is currently in beta, and will overwrite the last generated backup files.
